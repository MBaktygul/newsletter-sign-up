## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Scss
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript


### What I learned

- Form validation in JavaScript to create a better user experience
- DOM manipulation to dynamically update content and show/hide elements
- Event handling in JavaScript to control form submission and user interactions
- Implementing visual feedback states for form inputs (error and success states)
- How to dynamically update content based on user input

### Useful resources

- [Adding and hiding classes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/classList) - This helped me to manipulate hiding and showing classes in JavaScript.
  
I also received valuable guidance from my colleagues Olena and Norman who provided me with writing a JavaScript. Their input was especially helpful with the form validation logic.
